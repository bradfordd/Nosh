# Class Project Description for Android Development 
This is Nosh, an on-campus food delivery service that students, faculty, and employees of USF can use to 
have their favorite dining options delivered to them by bike. This will allow anyone who does not want to lose their favorite 
spot in the library (or any other public building), or to have a tough commute from class to class during lunch, or an employee 
who canâ€™t leave work to grab food to be able to have it delivered right to their location.  

# Requirements
* JDK 1.8 and above
* Android Studio

# Getting Started
* Open Android Studio to run the application on an emulator.
* Register for an account using an email and password.
* This version can currently add orders to a shopping cart, purchase the order, and show the location of
the order in real time as well as its status to the customer. If the user is an employee, the user can
agree to pick up an order and mark it as delivered.

### WARNING
* Only the menu for Subway is implemented for the purposes of demonstration.
* You cannot cancel an order.
* Drivers can only pick up one order at a time.
* Users can only make one order at a time, but each order can contain multiple items.
* GPS location services will not work if the driver is logged onto an emulator that does not have GPS capabilities or if simulated
GPS locations are not pre-loaded. Either use a physical device, or choose simulated locations for your emulator.

### Developers
* Laith Abdel-Rahman
* Dylan Bradford
